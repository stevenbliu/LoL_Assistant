# TODO:
- [~] Computer Vision
    - [x] Use PyQT to create an overlay that allows users to select parts of the screen to capture
    - [x] Use Tesseract-OCR to process selected parts as numbers
    - [x] Successfully able to get CS from top-right.
    - [~] Should also be able to get enemy/teammate CS via Scoreboard.
    - [ ] Potentially track appeareance and and locations of players via minimap
        - Very difficult
    - So we currently have real-time data for CS! This is great!
- [ ] ML
    - [ ] Main goal!
        - Predict pathing of enemy jungler! From their historical matches, we should know how they typically path. 
            - We can use similarity checks for team composition + other ML methods to determine it. 
            - It would be key to use similarity checks at different time ranges of the game, as compositions can change mid-game.
        - [x] Pre-processing of raw data from Riot API Data
        - [x] SKLEARN model as a baseline 
            -[~] Tuning
            -[x] Generate some metrics/plots
                - [x] Prediction vs True Scatter
                - [x] Residuals
                - [x] Feature Importance
- [ ] Riot API Data 
    - [~] Determine where to get historical match data. 
        - OP.gg sounds good because of lane score
        - [x] Integrated with Riot's Dev API. 
            - Succesfully managed collected data, contains x,y coordinates of players! We can use this to know camp clear path. 
            - Unfortunately, lacks granularity. Match data timesteps is 60s, that is a bit too long. 
        - [~] Investigating replay data via Live Client API to see what kind of data we can get from there.
        - [x] Currently using this to generate datasets of multiple matches

- [ ] Live Client
    - [x] Successfully integrated for real games, but data is too limited. Nothing useful can be collected durring a live match with Live Client. ~~(failed)~~
        - So in order to collect real-game data, we implemented a Computer Vision program to collect data by capturing it on screen.
    - [~] Working on integrating with replays.
        - [~] Develop a system that downloads replays, using the Live Client API to collect data with smaller timesteps. 
        - Download replay `/spectator/v4/download`. Parse the .rofl file with RoflParser or League of Stats. Processed and store data. Delete replay.
        - Unfortunately, Riot's API doesn't provide replays for Public games. Only for games you played yourself.
        - Possibly slow collect granular data over time? Users have the option to assist in collecting data for this? Until then, we may have to use the 60s.
        - Investgated .rofl files. In order to get info from it, we will have to reverse-engineer it. Very difficult and time consuming process, so we cannot use replays.
        - Alternative is to once again use CV to try to solve it. Might do this.
