GOAL:

"Real-time jungle path prediction app" that, during a game:

Identifies the enemy jungler

Pulls their historical pathing patterns

Predicts likely early paths (e.g., start buff â†’ gank pattern)

Updates predictions as more fog of war info is revealed



Current State:
Developed overlay that allow users to track certain metrics in-game. 
Example Usage: User draws boxes via the overlay of certain values to keep track of, such as enemy CS, and it will keep this count in mind. We will then use my knowledge to see what kind of information/advice/notifications we can draw from this.
